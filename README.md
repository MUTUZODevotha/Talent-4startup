**PROJECT**

**TITLE:AUTHOMATIC COIN-BASED PUBLIC TOILET PAYEMENT**

Our project focuses on implementing an automatic coin-based public toilet payment system. Users will insert a coin into a designated coin acceptor to access the toilet facility. Simultaneously, we will integrate air quality monitoring sensors within the toilet, with data transmitted to the Bylink platform. This innovative approach combines convenient access control with real-time environmental monitoring, enhancing user experience and promoting hygiene standards in publicÂ restrooms.

**Objectives:**

Develop an automatic coin-based access control system for public restroom facilities.
Integrate air quality monitoring sensors within the restroom to ensure a clean and hygienic environment.
Transmit sensor data to the Bylink platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.
Enhance user experience and promote hygiene standards in public restrooms.
Scope:

This project will focus on the design, development, and implementation of the automatic coin-based public toilet payment system with integrated air quality monitoring. It will cover the hardware and software components required for the system, as well as the integration with the Bylink platform. However, it will not address structural modifications to existing restroom facilities.

**Methodology:**

Research existing coin acceptor mechanisms and air quality monitoring sensors suitable for integration.
Design the system architecture, including hardware layout, sensor placement, and communication protocols.
Develop the software for controlling the coin acceptor, reading sensor data, and transmitting it to the Bylink platform.
Prototype and test the system in controlled environments to ensure functionality and reliability.
Deploy the system in a real-world public restroom facility and monitor its performance over time.

**Materials and Equipment:**

Coin acceptor mechanism (e.g., Coinco, Pyramid Technologies)

Microcontroller or single board computer (e.g., Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi)

Air quality monitoring sensors (e.g., temperature and humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, VOC sensor, PM sensor)

Connectivity modules (e.g., Wi-Fi module, Bluetooth module)

Power supply (e.g., battery pack, DC power adapter)

Enclosure (waterproof and durable)

Bylink platform access

LCD display, LED indicators, audible cues (for user interface)

**Design and Development:**


Design the physical layout of the system components within the restroom facility.
Develop the circuitry and software for the coin acceptor mechanism to control access.
Integrate air quality monitoring sensors into the system and establish communication with the microcontroller.
Implement protocols for transmitting sensor data to the Bylink platform.
Design the user interface for providing feedback to users during coin insertion and access.

**Implementation:**

Assemble the hardware components and install them in the restroom facility.
Configure and calibrate the coin acceptor mechanism and air quality monitoring sensors.
Develop and deploy the software for controlling the system and transmitting data to the Bylink platform.
Conduct initial testing to ensure proper functionality and integration of all components.
Make any necessary adjustments or refinements based on testing feedback.

**Testing and Evaluation:**

Test the system under various conditions to evaluate its performance and reliability.
Measure the accuracy of the coin acceptor mechanism in identifying and accepting coins.
Validate the readings from the air quality monitoring sensors against established standards.
Assess the responsiveness and effectiveness of the system's user interface.
Collect feedback from users and administrators to identify areas for improvement.

**Results and Analysis:**

Present the results of testing and evaluation, including performance metrics and user feedback.
Analyze the data collected from the air quality monitoring sensors to identify trends and patterns.
Evaluate the system's effectiveness in promoting hygiene standards and enhancing user experience.

**Discussion:**

Discuss the implications of the project's findings in relation to its objectives and scope.
Address any limitations or challenges encountered during the design, development, and implementation phases.
Explore potential future enhancements or adaptations to further improve the system's functionality and effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the Automatic Coin-Based Public Toilet Payment System with Integrated Air Quality Monitoring represents an innovative solution for managing public restroom facilities. By combining convenient access control with real-time environmental monitoring, our system enhances user experience and promotes hygiene standards in public restrooms. Through rigorous design, development, and testing, we have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges faced by modern urban environments.
