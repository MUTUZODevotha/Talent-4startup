</head>

<body>
  <h1>PROJECT</h1>
  <h2>TITLE:AUTHOMATIC COIN-BASED PUBLIC TOILET PAYEMENT</h2>
  <p>Our project focuses on implementing an automatic coin-based public toilet payment system. Users will insert a coin
    into a designated coin acceptor to access the toilet facility. Simultaneously, we will integrate air quality
    monitoring sensors within the toilet, with data transmitted to the Bylink platform. This innovative approach
    combines convenient access control with real-time environmental monitoring, enhancing user experience and promoting
    hygiene standards in public restrooms.</p>
  <h2>objective</h2>
  <p>Develop an automatic coin-based access control system for public restroom facilities.
    Integrate air quality monitoring sensors within the restroom to ensure a clean and hygienic environment.
    Transmit sensor data to the Bylink platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.
    Enhance user experience and promote hygiene standards in public restrooms.</p>
  <h2>scope</h2>
  <p>This project will focus on the design, development, and implementation of the automatic coin-based public toilet
    payment system with integrated air quality monitoring. It will cover the hardware and software components required
    for the system, as well as the integration with the Bylink platform. However, it will not address structural
    modifications to existing restroom facilities.
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology:</h2>
  <p>Research existing coin acceptor mechanisms and air quality monitoring sensors suitable for integration.
    Design the system architecture, including hardware layout, sensor placement, and communication protocols.
    Develop the software for controlling the coin acceptor, reading sensor data, and transmitting it to the Bylink
    platform.
    Prototype and test the system in controlled environments to ensure functionality and reliability.
    Deploy the system in a real-world public restroom facility and monitor its performance over time.</p>
  <h2>Materials and Equipment:</h2>
  <p>Coin acceptor mechanism (e.g., Coinco, Pyramid Technologies)
    Microcontroller or single board computer (e.g., Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi)
    Air quality monitoring sensors (e.g., temperature and humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, VOC sensor, PM sensor)
    Connectivity modules (e.g., Wi-Fi module, Bluetooth module)
    Power supply (e.g., battery pack, DC power adapter)
    Enclosure (waterproof and durable)
    Bylink platform access
    LCD display, LED indicators, audible cues (for user interface)
  </p>
  <h2>Design and Development:</h2>
  <p>Design the physical layout of the system components within the restroom facility. Develop the circuitry and
    software for the coin acceptor mechanism to control access. Integrate air quality monitoring sensors into the system
    and establish communication with the microcontroller. Implement protocols for transmitting sensor data to the Bylink
    platform. Design the user interface for providing feedback to users during coin insertion and access.</p>
  <h2>Implementation:</h2>
  <p>Assemble the hardware components and install them in the restroom facility. Configure and calibrate the coin
    acceptor mechanism and air quality monitoring sensors. Develop and deploy the software for controlling the system
    and transmitting data to the Bylink platform. Conduct initial testing to ensure proper functionality and integration
    of all components. Make any necessary adjustments or refinements based on testing feedback.</p>
  <h2>Testing and Evaluation:</h2>
  <p>Test the system under various conditions to evaluate its performance and reliability. Measure the accuracy of the
    coin acceptor mechanism in identifying and accepting coins. Validate the readings from the air quality monitoring
    sensors against established standards. Assess the responsiveness and effectiveness of the system's user interface.
    Collect feedback from users and administrators to identify areas for improvement</p>
