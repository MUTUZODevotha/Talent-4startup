  <h1>PROJECT</h1>
  <h1>TITLE:AUTHOMATIC COIN-BASED PUBLIC TOILET PAYEMENT</h1>
    <h2>Our project focuses on implementing an automatic coin-based public toilet payment system. Users will insert a coin into a designated coin acceptor to access the toilet facility. Simultaneously, we will integrate air quality monitoring sensors within the toilet, with data transmitted to the Bylink platform. This innovative approach combines convenient access control with real-time environmental monitoring, enhancing user experience and promoting hygiene standards in public restrooms.</h2>
<h1>objective</h1>
     <h2>Develop an automatic coin-based access control system for public restroom facilities.
      Integrate air quality monitoring sensors within the restroom to ensure a clean and hygienic environment.
      Transmit sensor data to the Bylink platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.
      Enhance user experience and promote hygiene standards in public restrooms.</h2>
      <h1>scope</h1>
      <h2>This project will focus on the design, development, and implementation of the automatic coin-based public toilet payment system with integrated air quality monitoring. It will cover the hardware and software components required for the system, as well as the integration with the Bylink platform. However, it will not address structural modifications to existing restroom facilities.
      </h2>
      <h1>Methodology:</h1>
      <h2>Research existing coin acceptor mechanisms and air quality monitoring sensors suitable for integration.
        Design the system architecture, including hardware layout, sensor placement, and communication protocols.
        Develop the software for controlling the coin acceptor, reading sensor data, and transmitting it to the Bylink platform.
        Prototype and test the system in controlled environments to ensure functionality and reliability.
        Deploy the system in a real-world public restroom facility and monitor its performance over time.</h2>
